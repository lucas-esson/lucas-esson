ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lucas Esson, a Renewable Test Engineer transitioning into Data Analysis.
With hands-on experience in upstream data collection from real-world renewable energy R&D, Iâ€™m now focused on building my technical skills in:

  a) Python (data wrangling, analysis, visualization)
  
  b) SQL (querying, data exploration)
  
  c) Power BI (dashboarding, storytelling)
  
I'm currently working on portfolio projects to showcase my ability to apply data skills to real-world problems, with the goal of moving into a Data Analyst role.
